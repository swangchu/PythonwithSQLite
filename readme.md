# Python with SQLite

**What is database ?**

    According to https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/
    
    A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
    A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS,along with the applications 
    that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

    Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to 
    make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. 
    Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.


**So SQLite ?**

    https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
    
    SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing 
    the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. 
    It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.
